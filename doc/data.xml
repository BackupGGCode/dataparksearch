<para>With <command>ActionSQL</command> command you can execute SQL-queries with document related data while indexing.
The syntax of <command>ActionSQL</command> command is as follow:
<programlisting>
ActionSQL &lt;section&gt; &lt;pattern&gt; &lt;sql-template&gt; [&lt;dbaddr&gt;]
</programlisting>
where &lt;section&gt; is the name of document section to check for regex pattern &gt;pattern&gt; match. If a match is found then the &lt;sql-template&gt; is filled with regex meta-variables $1-$9 as well with search template meta-variables (as for example, $(Title), $(Last-Modified), etc.) to form a sql-query, which is executed in the first DBAddr defined in indexer.conf file. If the optional &lt;dbaddr&gt; paramater of ActionSQL command is set, a new connection is set according this DBAddr and sql-query is executed in this connection.
</para>

<para>Thus you can use ActionSQL commands to mind and collect the data on pages while indexing. For example, the following command collect phone numbers (in Russian local notation) along with titles of pages where these phone numbers have been discovered:
<programlisting>
ActionSQL body "\(([0-9]{3})\)[ ]*([0-9]{3})[- \.]*([0-9]{2})[- \.]*([0-9]{2})" "INSERT INTO phonedata(phone,title)VALUES('+7$1$2$3$4','$(title)')"
</programlisting>
</para>
